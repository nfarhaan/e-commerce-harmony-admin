# WEB APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT ASSIGNMENT

In Part 2 of our project, we construct an admin website facilitating seamless product management using XML, XSD, XSLT, PHP, AJAX, and pico CSS. XML forms the data backbone, XSD ensures data integrity, and XSLT transforms data for user-friendly displays. PHP enables dynamic functionality, AJAX provides real-time interactivity, and pico CSS ensures a clean design. This amalgamation offers a comprehensive platform for adding, managing products, controlling inventory, and viewing stock levels, promising a streamlined and visually appealing management experience.
